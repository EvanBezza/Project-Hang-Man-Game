Project Hangman:

Game Overview:

The game hangman is a word guesing game with two or more players. One player (in this case the computer) picks a word and draws a line of dashes, one for every word. The other players must now try to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time. 

For each incorrect guess, a piece of the picture is drawn, for every correct guess made, the picture remains the same. If the player mkes the incorrect guess too many times and the image of the hangman get's fully drawn, the game is over and the player loses.

The player to guess the word before the picture is fully drawn wins.

Game Rules:

    1. One player thinks of a word and draws a series of dashes, one for each letter of the word.
    2. The other player(s) must try to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time or guessing the entire word at once.
    3. If the guessed letter or word is part of the word being guessed, it is added to the correct positions in the word.
    4. If the guessed letter or word is not part of the word being guessed, a part of the hangman is drawn.
    5. The game continues until the word is guessed correctly, or the drawing of the hangman is completed, resulting in the loss of the game.
    6. The player who correctly guesses the word or phrase is the winner.
